## My approach

#### Pre-code:
* I set up the project using ESLint from the beginning for best practices purposes. Also, I decided to follow the Airbnb style guide for the same reason.
* Next, I diagrammed the different classes and methods needed for this project following the Domain Modelling approach.

Regarding the development process, I tried to stick to this flow as much as possible:
* Unit Tests
* Implementation
* Refactoring

#### Development:
[TBC]
